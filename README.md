# Predicting perdormance drop of a ML model on an unlabelled target domain

A framework has been designed to estimate the performance shift of a model when evaluated on a new unlabelled target domain.  

We introduce a regression-based method that proposes two different domain-shift detection metrics and employs them to predict the performance shift of a model on a target domain on which ground truth labels are not available. The main advantage of this approach is that it has been designed to deal with unlabelled target data as often is in real-world clinical context. For this reason, it could address the issue of the lag between actual performance drift and labelled data becoming available. 

# Getting started
The main code that need to be executed lies within the 'main.Rmd' file.
